# COS BOILERPLATE (by: Struto)

## OVERVIEW
COS Boilerplate as per Struto development best practices. We have striped out all of the unwanted bulky CSS and kept it as clean as possible. It is easy to follow and very easy to add additional styles. 


## Easily include external stylesheets
```
@import url(http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,300,600,700);
@import url('//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.4.0/css/font-awesome.min.css');
```


## Really practical and easy to follow  
This is just so that you write better CSS...
